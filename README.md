# Discover CS Data Analysis

This data analysis is part of a larger project developed by the founders of Discover CS, an introductory programming course at the University of Michigan geared toward women and other underrepresented minorities in computer science. The data analyzed here was collected from surveys given to students of or tied to Discover CS. These findings give us insights into how we can most effectively recruit and retain underrepresented peoples in computer science.
